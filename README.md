#  Project Story

## 1.Inspiration

With the flourishing of various DeFi projects and DAO organizations, more and more projects are conducting various marketing activities. In this process, token airdrops have become one of the most important marketing measures. A DeFi project has its own contract engineer who tailors the airdrop plan according to the project's reality. However, many DAO organizations do not have enough technical strength, they need a general token airdrop system. This is the inspiration for our current system: enable anyone who does not understand code to issue airdrops through modular operations.

## 2.What it does

DAO token airdrop system is normally used for various types of DAO organizations to airdrop their governance tokens to those who contribute to communities, so that their contributions are encouraged.

Token airdrops are one of the most commonly used and important tools for every DAO organization. Through the airdrop system, DAO organization can motivate community contributors on the one hand, and on the other hand, it can also send its own governance tokens to more target groups to expand the influence of the DAO organization. Now token airdrops have become one of the most important marketing tools for various crypto communities.

## 3.How we built it

Our token airdrop system has two functions:

The first is to issue batches of tokens actively. The project party of the airdrop directly sends tokens as reward to certain airdrop account in batches, that is, to send tokens in batches. The GAS fee consumed by the token sending contract will be paid by the airdrop project party.

The second function is passive collection of tokens. The qualified wallet addresses and numbers of airdrop rewards are written into smart contracts, so that eligible wallets can take their airdrops by themselves. During the process, you can set a time to take airdrop. If the airdrop time has passed and there are still a certain amount of tokens that have not been claimed, the remaining tokens can be sent into one address automatically, for instance, the community multi-signature vault.
