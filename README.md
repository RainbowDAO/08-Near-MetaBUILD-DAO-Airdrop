## 7.What is the RainbowCity Foundation？


RainbowCity Foundation is a non-profit foundation initiated and founded by Mr. RainbowKun. Headquartered in Singapore, Asia, it mainly engages in the incubation and investment of the crypto ecosystem. Mr. RainbowKun himself is a loyal fan of Bitcoin and a believer of Satoshi Nakamoto, dedicated to the spread of Satoshi Nakamoto's decentralized ideas. He once put forward the concept of "Bit Civilization" for the first time in the world in July 2021 at the Bitcointalk Forum established by Satoshi Nakamoto , hoping to promote the development of the encryption industry worldwide and practice the true Bitcoin spirit.


Mr. Rainbow Kun believes that in the crypto world, human civilization will have an unprecedented super economy in the future. It is constructed in the form of a decentralized protocol, which puts different and decentralized economic behaviors into a unified economy, and truly becomes the infrastructure of future human civilization in the future. The Rainbow city Foundation was established under this background.

The RainbowCity Foundation plans to invest in 7 major areas in the next ten years, including Rainbow DeFi, Rainbow Investment, Rainbow Culture, Rainbow Network, Rainbow Industry, Rainbow Education and Rainbow R&D. Strive to become a super economy with a market value of one trillion US dollars. The RainbowDAO Protocol is the first project launched by the Rainbowcity Foundation to build the infrastructure of the DAO ecosystem and contribute our wisdom and strength to the development of the global DAO career.

#  Project Story

## 1.Inspiration



With the flourishing of various DeFi projects and DAO organizations, more and more projects are conducting various marketing activities. In this process, token airdrops have become one of the most important marketing measures. A DeFi project has its own contract engineer who tailors the airdrop plan according to the project's reality. However, many DAO organizations do not have enough technical strength, they need a general token airdrop system. This is the inspiration for our current system: enable anyone who does not understand code to issue airdrops through modular operations.

## 2.What it does



DAO token airdrop system is normally used for various types of DAO organizations to airdrop their governance tokens to those who contribute to communities, so that their contributions are encouraged.

Token airdrops are one of the most commonly used and important tools for every DAO organization. Through the airdrop system, DAO organization can motivate community contributors on the one hand, and on the other hand, it can also send its own governance tokens to more target groups to expand the influence of the DAO organization. Now token airdrops have become one of the most important marketing tools for various crypto communities.

## 3.How we built it




![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RainbowDAO/01-Near-MetaBUILD-RainbowDAO-Factory/main/pic/Logic-diagram/08-Logic-diagram-of-airdrop-system.png)

Our token airdrop system has two functions:

The first is to issue batches of tokens actively. The project party of the airdrop directly sends tokens as reward to certain airdrop account in batches, that is, to send tokens in batches. The GAS fee consumed by the token sending contract will be paid by the airdrop project party.

The second function is passive collection of tokens. The qualified wallet addresses and numbers of airdrop rewards are written into smart contracts, so that eligible wallets can take their airdrops by themselves. During the process, you can set a time to take airdrop. If the airdrop time has passed and there are still a certain amount of tokens that have not been claimed, the remaining tokens can be sent into one address automatically, for instance, the community multi-signature vault.

## 4.Challenges we ran into

The DAO token airdrop system is a relatively simple system, but very practical and has a fairly broad application scenarios. In the process of developing this product, the biggest challenge for us is how to figure out the logic of the product to deal with the token airdrop behavior in different scenarios.

## 5.Accomplishments that we're proud of

The achievement we feel proud of is that our system allows anyone who does not understand code to conduct complicated airdrop activities, it helps those people conduct DAO marketing activities.


## 6.What we learned

We learned that various types of DAOs organize marketing activities for different application scenarios, which made our understanding of DAOs deeper.


## 7.What's next for DAO Airdrop System？ 

Our work next is to continue to sort out the details of this product, reconstruct the logic of the product and make this product as adaptable as possible to meet the needs of various types of DAO organizations. When the product functions are further improved, we will submit an external audit. When the audit is done, we will deploy the product to each public chain.
