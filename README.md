## 7.What is the RainbowCity Foundation？

Headquartered in Singapore, RainbowCity Foundation is a non-profit foundation founded by Mr. Kunyuan, which mainly engages in the incubation and investment of the crypto ecosystem. Being a big fan of Bitcoin, Mr. Kunyuan worships Satoshi Nakamoto and dedicates himself to the spread of Satoshi Nakamoto’s great ideas of decentralization. He once put forward the concept of “Bit Civilization” for the first time in the world in July 2021 at the Bitcointalk Forum established by Satoshi Nakamoto. Moreover, he wrote over 50 articles to promote Bitcoin, in the hope of fostering the development of the encryption industry worldwide and practicing the true Bitcoin spirit.

Mr. Kunyuan has had rich experiences in the crypto world. At one time, he was the highest community leader of FCoin, the most influential community exchange in the Chinese world. In November 2018, in a referendum on the FCoin exchange, Mr. Kunyuan was elected the first community committee member and then appointed vice Chairman to fully preside over the work of the FCoin community.

Mr. Kunyuan believes that a super economic powerhouse will emerge in the mankind history in the future; a crypto world which is constructed in the form of decentralized protocols that transform all different decentralized behaviors into a unified economy. He believes it will ultimately become the infrastructure of human civilization and this is in which the RainbowCity foundation originates from this belief.

The RainbowCity Foundation aims to invest in seven major industries in the following ten years, including Rainbow DeFi, Rainbow Investment, Rainbow Culture, Rainbow Network, Rainbow Industry, Rainbow Education and Rainbow R&D. It strives to become a super economic hub with market value worth one trillion US dollars.

#  Project Story

## 1.Inspiration



With the flourishing of various DeFi projects and DAO organizations, more and more projects are conducting various marketing activities. In this process, token airdrops have become one of the most important marketing measures. A DeFi project has its own contract engineer who tailors the airdrop plan according to the project's reality. However, many DAO organizations do not have enough technical strength, they need a general token airdrop system. This is the inspiration for our current system: enable anyone who does not understand code to issue airdrops through modular operations.

## 2.What it does



DAO token airdrop system is normally used for various types of DAO organizations to airdrop their governance tokens to those who contribute to communities, so that their contributions are encouraged.

Token airdrops are one of the most commonly used and important tools for every DAO organization. Through the airdrop system, DAO organization can motivate community contributors on the one hand, and on the other hand, it can also send its own governance tokens to more target groups to expand the influence of the DAO organization. Now token airdrops have become one of the most important marketing tools for various crypto communities.

## 3.How we built it




![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RainbowDAO/01-Near-MetaBUILD-RainbowDAO-Factory/main/pic/Logic-diagram/08-Logic-diagram-of-airdrop-system.png)

Our token airdrop system has two functions:

The first is to issue batches of tokens actively. The project party of the airdrop directly sends tokens as reward to certain airdrop account in batches, that is, to send tokens in batches. The GAS fee consumed by the token sending contract will be paid by the airdrop project party.

The second function is passive collection of tokens. The qualified wallet addresses and numbers of airdrop rewards are written into smart contracts, so that eligible wallets can take their airdrops by themselves. During the process, you can set a time to take airdrop. If the airdrop time has passed and there are still a certain amount of tokens that have not been claimed, the remaining tokens can be sent into one address automatically, for instance, the community multi-signature vault.

## 4.Challenges we ran into

The DAO token airdrop system is a relatively simple system, but very practical and has a fairly broad application scenarios. In the process of developing this product, the biggest challenge for us is how to figure out the logic of the product to deal with the token airdrop behavior in different scenarios.

## 5.Accomplishments that we're proud of

The achievement we feel proud of is that our system allows anyone who does not understand code to conduct complicated airdrop activities, it helps those people conduct DAO marketing activities.


## 6.What we learned

We learned that various types of DAOs organize marketing activities for different application scenarios, which made our understanding of DAOs deeper.


## 7.What's next for DAO Airdrop System？ 

Our work next is to continue to sort out the details of this product, reconstruct the logic of the product and make this product as adaptable as possible to meet the needs of various types of DAO organizations. When the product functions are further improved, we will submit an external audit. When the audit is done, we will deploy the product to each public chain.
